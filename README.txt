Hello thank you for viewing my very first PID Project!

Title: Python PID Controller (simple)
Author: Douglas Snow
Date: January 11, 2023
Objective: Learn python and a bit about PID at the same time (accomplished)

Overview:
There are three files in this package. 
  - human_driver.py  -- allows the user to command the spaceship using 'a' and 'd' keys
  - position_driver.py -- a simple position based control of the spaceship in an attempt to dock it: thrust is proportional to distance from dock point (x=0)
  - PID_driver.py -- a complete position, derivative, and integral controller for spaceship which allows user to type 'g' and input an outside force (solar wind) on the spaceship
